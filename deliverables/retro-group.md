# Group Retrospective

## What went well in the group...

- **Collaboration**: Team members consistently contributed ideas and assisted each other with technical challenges.
- **Efficient Sprints**: Weekly sprints allowed the team to track progress and adapt quickly to any blockers.
- **Clear Communication**: Regular meetings and use of Discord ensured everyone was aligned on the project's direction.

## What could have been better in the group...

- **Research**: More research could have been done before jumping into the SDP and designing.
- **Time Management**: Some tasks extended beyond the sprint deadlines, affecting the overall timeline.
- **Skill Gaps**: Certain team members had less experience with Svelte or Discord.js, which slowed progress.
- **Task Delegation**: More structured divide of tasks could have prevented some bottlenecks in development.

## What went well in the class...

- **Clear Guidance**: The instructor provided clear expectations and resources for project milestones.
- **Engaging Discussions**: Class discussions offered valuable insights into refining project features.
- **Guest Lectures**: The guest lectures were beneficial in providing real-world insights and advice on software engineering, enriching the learning experience.

## What could have been better in the class...

- Some activities felt like they overlapped too much and could be changed in preference for additional group time in class.
- Having groups explain their diagrams to eachother after finishing to help get people more comfortable to talk in class.

## Further Comments

- The project emphasized real-world development workflows, which was highly beneficial for skill-building.
- A follow-up session on advanced tools (e.g., testing frameworks for bots) would be helpful for future projects.
- The balance between technical development and design considerations was challenging but rewarding.
