## Introduction

This document outlines the testing plan for the Discord bot developed using `discord.js`. The bot’s functionalities include managing roles, processing event registrations, sending automated alerts, and interacting with external APIs. Testing will ensure all features function as expected, with robust error handling.

## Environment Setup

1. Ensure the following prerequisites are met:
   - Sveltekit monorepo ith turborepo.
   - `discord.js` properly configured.
   - Jest for testing.
   - Required environment variables set in a `.env` file.
   - Dummy Discord accounts and a separate testing bot added to the testing server.
   - External API endpoints available and responding.
2. Use a testing-specific Discord server to prevent disruption in production servers.

## Testing Scope

The testing process includes:

- Validation of bot initialization and environment setup.
- Mocking discord client with jest for testing.
- Execution of all commands.
- Handling of user interactions, including invalid inputs.
- Verification of external API integrations.
- Confirmation of proper error handling across all functionalities.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Bot Initialization

- **Objective**: Ensure the bot initializes without errors.
- **Steps**:
  1. Starting the bot inside the bot folder.
  2. Verify the bot logs in successfully.
  3. Check for any initialization-related logs in the console.
- **Expected Result**: The bot logs in, displays a “Successfully logged in as BOT_ID(Discord APP Name)” message, and is visible online in the server.

---

### 2. Environment Variables

- **Objective**: Ensure all required environment variables are correctly configured.
- **Steps**:
  1. Verify `.env` file includes necessary variables (e.g., `BOT_TOKEN`, `API_KEY`).
  2. Intentionally remove or misconfigure an environment variable.
  3. Restart the bot and check for error logs.
- **Expected Result**: The bot identifies missing variables and logs appropriate errors.

---

### 3. Command Execution

#### a. **Valid Commands**

- **Objective**: Ensure all commands execute correctly.
- **Steps**:
  1. Test each bot command with valid inputs.
  2. Observe responses in the Discord server.
  3. Check for logs confirming successful command execution.
- **Expected Result**: The bot executes each command as intended and provides the correct output.

#### b. **Invalid Commands**

- **Objective**: Verify the bot handles invalid inputs gracefully.
- **Steps**:
  1. Input non-existent or malformed commands.
  2. Observe the bot’s response in the server.
  3. Check for any error logs in the console.
- **Expected Result**: The bot returns an appropriate error message without crashing.

# Sample Slash Command Test using Jest

This is an example of how to test a simple slash command using Jest. The test will mock the necessary `discord.js` interactions to verify that the bot responds correctly to a command.

## Sample Test: helloCommand

```javascript
// helloCommand.test.js
const { Client, CommandInteraction } = require('discord.js');
const helloCommand = require('./commands/helloCommand'); // your command file

jest.mock('discord.js'); // Mock discord.js interactions

describe('Slash Command: hello', () => {
  it('should send a hello message', async () => {
    // Create a mock interaction
    const mockInteraction = {
      reply: jest.fn(), // Mock the reply method
    };

    // Execute the command
    await helloCommand.execute(mockInteraction);

    // Check that the bot replied correctly
    expect(mockInteraction.reply).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Hello, World!');
  });
});
```

### 4. Error Handling

- **Objective**: Validate try-catch blocks and error messages for bot interactions.
- **Steps**:
  1. Simulate runtime errors (e.g., by interacting with unresponsive external APIs or incorrect command usage).
  2. Test failure scenarios for external API requests.
  3. Check logs for error messages.
- **Expected Result**: The bot logs detailed error messages, notifies users about failures where applicable, and continues running.

---

### 5. External API Integration

- **Objective**: Ensure proper interaction with external APIs.
- **Steps**:
  1. Test all functionalities relying on external APIs.
  2. Verify error handling.
- **Expected Result**: API interactions are successful, and errors are logged appropriately with user-friendly messages when failures occur.

---

## Testing Procedure

1. Run the bot locally using `npm run test` inside the bot workspace.
2. Conduct the following tests sequentially:
   - Verify bot initialization.
   - Test each command with valid and invalid inputs.
   - Simulate scenarios for missing/invalid environment variables.
   - Test interactions with external APIs.
   - Ensure proper error messages are displayed and logged.
3. Use dummy accounts and a secondary testing bot for safe interactions.

## Conclusion

This testing plan provides a structured approach to validating the Discord bot’s functionality, error handling, and integration with external APIs. Comprehensive testing will ensure the bot operates reliably and handles unexpected scenarios gracefully.
