# Testing Plan

## Testing Elements

1. **Unit Testing**

   - Validate individual bot commands, including the `announce` command.
   - Test message parsing and response generation for edge cases.

2. **Integration Testing**

   - Ensure the bot integrates seamlessly with the Discord API.
   - Test workflows involving multiple commands and interactions.

3. **End-to-End Testing (E2E)**

   - Simulate real-world scenarios where users interact with the bot.
   - Validate behavior in private and public channels, as well as handling of permission-restricted servers.

4. **Load and Performance Testing**

   - Assess bot performance under high user loads or rapid sequential commands.

5. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Test fallback behavior for invalid commands and API outages.

## Testing Framework

1. **Jest**

   - Ideal for unit and integration tests due to its simplicity and wide support for JavaScript/TypeScript.
   - Already configured for your bot, minimizing additional setup effort.

   ### Sample test

   ```javascript
   const { Client, CommandInteraction } = require("discord.js");
   const helloCommand = require("./commands/helloCommand"); // your command file

   jest.mock("discord.js"); // Mock discord.js interactions

   describe("Slash Command: hello", () => {
     it("should send a hello message", async () => {
       // Create a mock interaction
       const mockInteraction = {
         reply: jest.fn(), // Mock the reply method
       };

       // Execute the command
       await helloCommand.execute(mockInteraction);

       // Check that the bot replied correctly
       expect(mockInteraction.reply).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Hello, World!");
     });
   });
   ```

## Justification

### Justification of Testing Plan

- **Fit with Development Plan**:  
  The plan aligns with an iterative and modular development methodology, ensuring incremental verification at each layer.
- **Comprehensiveness**:  
  Covers critical test areas: functionality, integration, and performance.
- **Scalability**:  
  The approach allows the addition of more complex tests as the bot evolves.

### Justification of Frameworks

- **Jest**:

  - Easy to use for mocking Discord interactions.
  - Well-documented and supports plugins for extended functionality.
  - Already part of the current setup, which enhances productivity.
