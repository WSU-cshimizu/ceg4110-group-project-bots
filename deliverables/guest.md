- Question 2

## Lessons Learned

Determining priority order for managing work done by looking at production time and impact of a feature in determining what gets worked on first. You can quantify most things to help visualize the impact of a feature on the user. For example, the amount of time wasted by the user because of the lack of a feature or placement of one.

development cycle is important and the strategy to tackle needs to be put into consideration. SCRUM for this example is horrible for service based industries due to the day to day issues that come up or the unexpected events that could occur.
Priority of things can vary depending on each person and sometimes people think their problem is more important than others, so talking it over with the group will help decide the next steps for the problem.

If a reason is provided, a "why" per se, for a requirement/feature, it is often easier for developers to figure out the little things that might go wrong or might slip through QA that others might miss.

## Guest 2

- **Guest Lecturer:** `Todd Irlbeack `
- **Company:** `Riverside Research`
- **Date:** `10 October 2024`

## Pertinent Questions

- How can teams help developers overcome their hesitance to adopt LLMs, considering that these tools can significantly enhance workflow efficiency, especially if developers feel that using them undermines their coding skills?

- What strategies can teams implement to effectively manage and resolve conflicts that arise during Agile sprints, particularly when team members have differing opinions on task priorities or implementation approaches?

## Lessons Learned

- Operating efficiently and adapting quickly to changing demands is crucial in any fast-paced environment.

- Itâ€™s essential to be careful about the software used and the code shared, as some tools may access the codebase. Keeping tools secure helps protect intellectual property.

- Using a custom LLM shows how important it is to keep information private. This allows for safely using proprietary data, highlighting the need for tools that protect sensitive information.

## Guest 3

- **Guest Lecturer:** `Chris Schrameck`
- **Company:** `Winsupply`
- **Date:** `24 October 2024`

## Pertinent Questions
- Creating their own software instead of using big popular ones. How viable is this?
  
- Why are scrum and kanban the preferred agile frameworks and what does that say about the company?

## Lessons Learned
- WinSupply runs multiple different methodology, Agile, Scrum, Kanban.
- AI, ChatGPT (llm) big fixation right now. Even WinSupply trying to create solutions/products using AI.
- AI/ChatGPT getting dumber with each iteration/release.
- Trend on the industry has been "how can we handle products".
- Number one issue seen is the lack of communication and understanding between the buissness end (investors and corporate) and the technology end (programmers). The buisness end might want to have something done that is not necessarily within possibility or reasonability for the tech end and that leads to failiure.
- Split team across 2 different time zones allows for much more efficient work hours in the day. For example, with a 10 hour time zone differnce, there will be at least one team working for almost 20 hours in a day.
- Looking at technology in the long term. "How will this help us for the next 10 years" and not "how can we use this to solve a problem for tomorrow".
