## Lessons Learned

Determining priority order for managing work done by looking at production time and impact of a feature in determining what gets worked on first. You can quantify most things to help visualize the impact of a feature on the user. For example, the amount of time wasted by the user because of the lack of a feature or placement of one.

development cycle is important and the strategy to tackle needs to be put into consideration. SCRUM for this example is horrible for service based industries due to the day to day issues that come up or the unexpected events that could occur.
Priority of things can vary depending on each person and sometimes people think their problem is more important than others, so talking it over with the group will help decide the next steps for the problem.

If a reason is provided, a "why" per se, for a requirement/feature, it is often easier for developers to figure out the little things that might go wrong or might slip through QA that others might miss.

## Pertinent Questions

- How can teams help developers overcome their hesitance to adopt LLMs, considering that these tools can significantly enhance workflow efficiency, especially if developers feel that using them undermines their coding skills?

- What strategies can teams implement to effectively manage and resolve conflicts that arise during Agile sprints, particularly when team members have differing opinions on task priorities or implementation approaches?

## Lessons Learned

- Operating efficiently and adapting quickly to changing demands is crucial in any fast-paced environment.

- It’s essential to be careful about the software used and the code shared, as some tools may access the codebase. Keeping tools secure helps protect intellectual property.

- Using a custom LLM shows how important it is to keep information private. This allows for safely using proprietary data, highlighting the need for tools that protect sensitive information.
